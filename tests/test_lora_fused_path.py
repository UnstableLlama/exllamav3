"""
Guards for the fused-decode / runtime-LoRA interaction (Session 22 finding).

The fused multi-linear decode kernels (exl3_mgemm over MultiLinear pairs, the
BC_GatedMLP bsz-1 graph) read trellis storage directly and never call
Linear.forward -- which is the only place a runtime LoRA (model.lora.LoRA) is
applied. Before the fix, token-by-token generation on an EXL3-quantized base
silently dropped the k/v (and gated-attn q), gate/up (and BC-path down) LoRA
components, so an adapter that visibly steered the training-side forward
looked like a no-op at inference. The mgemm branches in attention
(attn/sliding_attn) and GatedMLP now stay fused and add the low-rank delta
onto the mgemm output (pre-RoPE / pre-activation, matching Linear.forward
semantics -- MultiLinear pairs are bias/softcap/scale-free by construction).
The whole-block graph paths (bc_attn/bc_swa, the BC bsz-1 MLP graph, the GDN
split graph, the fused MoE expert kernels) cannot take a post-hoc delta and
still fall back to unfused dispatch while any involved Linear carries LoRA
tensors.

Because the failure mode is SILENT (generation stays coherent, the adapter
just doesn't run), these tests are tripwires on the guard conditions in the
source itself, dependency-free so they run in any container. The semantics of
the helper are tested with real imports where torch is available. The real
end-to-end check -- an adapter visibly changing bsz=1 decode output on an EXL3
quant, fused kernels present -- needs a GPU and a quantized model; it is on
the handoff box list, not here.
