Transformers-free differentiable Llama forward over native EXL3 weights.

Why this exists
---------------
The HF Transformers integration (``exllamav3/integration/transformers.py``)
turns an EXL3 model into a trainable graph by replacing only the linear
layers and letting stock Transformers supply norms/attention/RoPE. That works
in principle but couples training to a single Transformers version: the EXL3
Llama-3.2 weights were calibrated against transformers 4.45, and 5.x changed
``llama3`` RoPE handling, producing a correct-per-layer but garbage-overall
forward (see ``doc/qlora_handoff.md``).

This module sidesteps that entirely. It reconstructs the Llama decoder forward
in plain, autograd-friendly PyTorch directly on top of exllamav3's *own* loaded
modules -- the same weights, RoPE settings (``RoPE.inv_freq``), norms and
attention scale that the native (correct) inference forward uses. There is no
``transformers`` import anywhere in the path, so it cannot be broken by an
upstream version bump.

The quantized base weights stay frozen and are reconstructed on the fly from
the trellis via ``LinearEXL3.get_weight_tensor()`` (orientation ``[in, out]``,
``y = x @ W``). Only the low-rank ``lora_a`` / ``lora_b`` adapters train, routed
through the gradchecked :class:`EXL3LoRAFunction`. The LM head is handled by the
streaming :func:`fused_linear_cross_entropy`, so the ``[tokens, vocab]`` logit
tensor is never materialized during training.

Scope: pre-norm decoders. Every norm / activation / scale is read from the
loaded modules (see ``backbone.norm_spec``), so one block forward covers
Llama/Mistral/Qwen2 (plain), Qwen3 (q/k-norm), Gemma3/4 (q/k/v-norm + sandwich
post-norms + GeGLU + alternating sliding/full window + per-layer head dims +
logit softcapping), and the Qwen3.5/3.6 hybrid: GatedDeltaNet layers (a
differentiable gated delta rule -- see ``training.gdn``; the fla
``chunk_gated_delta_rule`` Triton kernel on CUDA fp16/bf16, the sequential
fp32 reference elsewhere) and gated full-attention layers (interleaved output
gate). It reduces bit-identically to the original Llama path when those
features are absent. Still rejected loudly (``assert_block_supported``):
fused-qkvz GatedDeltaNet (Qwen3-Next layout), MoE, headwise attention gating
(g_proj), mRoPE, partial rotary and non-NeoX RoPE. Sample packing is not
supported on GatedDeltaNet models (the recurrence would carry state across
packed document boundaries); train them unpacked.
