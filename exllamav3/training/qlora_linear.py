"""
Differentiable LoRA-over-frozen-EXL3 linear (QLoRA proof of concept).

Background
----------
QLoRA freezes the (quantized) base weights and trains only the low-rank
adapter matrices A and B. Crucially, *no gradient ever needs to flow
through the quantizer*: the frozen weight behaves as a constant in the
computation graph, exactly like NF4 in bitsandbytes-based QLoRA. All we
need for a correct backward pass is:

  - ``grad_x``  -- to propagate loss to earlier layers, and
  - ``grad_A`` / ``grad_B`` -- to update the adapter.

both of which are ordinary matmuls once the effective FP16 weight has been
reconstructed from the EXL3 trellis. EXL3 already exposes that
reconstruction via ``LinearEXL3.get_weight_tensor()`` (the full effective
weight, with the sign flips ``suh``/``svh`` and Hadamard rotations folded
in), so the "scary" part -- differentiating a 3-bit trellis code -- never
enters the picture for QLoRA.

This module provides two things:

  1. ``reference_forward`` -- the dead-simple version that just runs plain
     torch ops with the dequantized weight detached to a constant, and
     lets autograd do everything. This is the ground truth.

  2. ``EXL3LoRAFunction`` -- a memory-efficient ``autograd.Function`` that
     does *not* stash the dequantized weight for the backward pass but
     instead re-derives it from the (cheap, already-on-device) trellis via
     a ``weight_fn`` closure. This is the shape of the kernel a real
     training path would use: it keeps the big FP16 weight out of the saved
     activation set. Its hand-written backward is validated against (1) and
     against ``torch.autograd.gradcheck`` in ``tests/test_qlora_grad.py``.

Nothing here touches the inference path. It is deliberately standalone so
the "is this even real?" question can be answered by a single gradcheck.

    128-block Hadamard, symmetric and orthogonal), which costs four extra

    emits it directly, so every ``.to()`` below is a no-op; whatever the mock
