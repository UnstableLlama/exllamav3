"""
The single seam between the native training forward and exllamav3 internals.

``exllamav3/training/native_llama.py`` reconstructs a differentiable
Llama/Mistral decoder on top of an already-loaded ``exllamav3.Model``. Doing so
requires reading exllamav3's *internal* module layout: the ``..modules`` types,
the loaded RoPE table, RMSNorm epsilons, and the trellis weight reconstruction.
Every such reach lives here and nowhere else, so the training code above depends
on a small, named surface instead of scattered attribute access.

Why isolate it: this is the natural API boundary for the work. If it is ever
promoted into exllamav3 as a supported training entry point, this is the file
that moves (or becomes a thin shim); ``native_llama.py`` would be unaffected.
And a standalone trainer that pins exllamav3 would depend on exactly this
surface and nothing deeper.

``..modules`` is imported lazily, inside the functions that need it, so that
importing this module never triggers the CUDA extension build.

    ``q`` / ``k`` / ``v`` are ``[total_tokens, num_heads, head_dim]``: every
    document of a packed batch concatenated into one token stream, with
    ``cu_seqlens`` (int32, shape ``[num_docs + 1]``, cumulative document lengths)

    ``max_seqlen`` is the longest document length.

    paged/cache backend and lands on ``fn_flash_attn_varlen_func`` -- the upstream
    ``flash_attn_varlen_func``, which (unlike exllamav3's inference kernels) is NOT
    wrapped in ``inference_mode`` and has a real backward. Requires
    ``head_dim <= 256`` (FA2 limit; the caller routes larger heads elsewhere).

    ``window > 0`` is a sliding window expressed as exllamav3's per-layer
    ``sliding_window`` (a token attends to itself + ``window - 1`` previous tokens
    = ``window`` total). We hand ``attn_dispatch`` ``window - 1`` because its

# back-to-back per block, so caching the weight between exactly those two
# calls removes one reconstruction per step at the memory cost of one block's
# frozen weights held live at a time.
#
# Box-measured (Session 30): under the FAST dequant path this trade is a net
# loss -- inner-only reconstructions are so cheap (0.06-0.23 ms) that the
# cache's bookkeeping and allocator pressure cost ~1-4% tok/s AND +0.5-1.5 GB
# peak VRAM (worst on many-expert MoE). It therefore defaults OFF; it can pay
# only under --dequant-mode legacy, where each avoided reconstruction is a
# 5-7 ms full get_weight_tensor.
#
# The trainer wraps ``loss.backward()`` in ``backward_dequant_cache()``; while
# the phase is active a closure's first call stores its result and the second
# call returns-and-evicts it (so a block's weights free as its backward
# consumes them). Outside the phase every call is a plain reconstruction --
# eval, validation and the outer forward are untouched. Correct for any call
# count: an unpaired store is dropped when the phase ends, a third call is
# just a fresh miss. Closures whose result is consumed only once per backward
# (the fused-CE head) are deliberately NOT cache-wrapped -- they would hold
# the weight for the whole phase for no reuse.
